Constructors/init functions in python

invoked everytime an object is created

non-attribute based

def __init__(self):


with parameters

def __init__(self,parameter1):
   self.variable=parameter1

The above is same as x.Classname(parameter1)

You can also pass a default value in a constructor

eg: for an Instagram account

def __init__ (self,name,id):
self.username=name
self.userid=id
self.followercount=0 > no need to define in constructor definition


function attached to an object is called method.method needs to have first parameter called as "self"
