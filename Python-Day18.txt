Turtle graphics(deepdive),tuples,importing modules

from turtle import *
gets everything but not a good practice

import turtle as t
treats module turtle and treating it as alias t

for modules that cant be imported
note: you can import only those modules that come as part of standaard python library

for others, you need to install modules


tuples
3 elements, ordered in alist enclosed by circular brackets
tuple elements cannot be modified i.e. immutable

so if you still wish to modify tuple contents
you need to pass it to a list
eg: list(tuple_name)
output will be tuple elements enclosed in square brackets
