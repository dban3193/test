Namespaces= Local vs Global scope

generally you are not allowed to modify a global variable inside a function.
If you really want to do it, use "global" keyword in front of the variable nside function

However it is not advisable 


still if you wish to do that, use return statements for modifications

global variables get a uppercase defintion as per python naming convention
