# test

So far I have attempted creating new files adding them to staging area, commiting them.
Creating a branch, switching through branches, commiting into a new branch,merging two branches
checking status,log
cloning github repo locally
initializing remote repo
pushing changes to master


since we dont attempt that directly irl, I am creating a branch called development, add some files, and generate a PR
