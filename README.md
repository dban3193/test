# test

So far I have attempted creating new files adding them to staging area, commiting them.
Creating a branch, switching through branches, commiting into a new branch,merging two branches
checking status,log
cloning github repo locally
initializing remote repo
pushing changes to master


since we dont attempt that directly irl, I am creating a branch called development, add learning.txt, and generate a PR
PR was approved and the merge pull request was successfully performed

To implement the same locally i.e. ensuring local and remote stay in sync, we performed a git pull origin master.

In case of merge conflicts, pull origin master locally, edit the necessary file(it will have merged data), and then do a git push


Forking is done by someone who wants to contribute to an open source repo.
