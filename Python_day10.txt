Day-10 Python

*Learnt about return statements used in functions which take input and return output
*
lower() to lowercase stuff
upper() to uppercase stuff
title() makes sure only first letter of a word is caps rest all are lower

Also there are some boolean checks available like isupper(),islower() and istitle()

*DocStrings are ways of documenting while we code, especially when we custom create something
for eg: we created a function to titlelize the inputs, a custom function

To enter a docstring, (basically what that function does)
the first statement in your function is going to be starting with 3 ' and ending with another 3 '
inside this you can define what your function does.
finally outside the function when you invoke it. if you scroll cursor over the function, you can see the definition you gave it


Print vs return statement

if you wish to reuse an output in the same code, use return statements else print works fine

Recursion is a function calling itself, with no input or output
