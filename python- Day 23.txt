open() is used to open a text file and we can store this opned file in a variable
eg: we have a file called me.txt

content = open("me.txt")
NOTE: if only text input is given to open(), default mode if read-only

output = content.read()

read function takes input of output returned from open function
you can do stuff with "output", example , print(output)

NOTE: open() consumes resources. Remember to manually close the file once work is complete to free resources

content.close()


However we might forget to close the file after work's complete, in such cases "with" keyword comes in handy

with open("me.txt") as <somevariablename>:
    output = <varabove>.read()
    print(output)

with keyword will handle everything. 

******To write to a file

first you need to change mode

with open("me.txt",mode="w") as file:
       file.write("new text")

if you were to check me.txt contents now, it has fully been replaced by "new text"
if you only wish to append, use mode="a"

if a file wasnt present already, but mode="w" set, a new file will get created with the same name you used with "open"

Note that the filename you pass in open command, you need to pass a relative path if the file is under same project, if not you need to mention absolute path of the file


Some new functions:

replace()
It replaces a string with another string in a file/func etc.
syntax:
filename.replace(oldvalue,newvalue,<count>)
count is the number of occureneces you wish to change

readlines()
This method returns a list containing each line in file as list item
you can store it's output to a variable
eg: new_list = <txtfilename>.readlines()

NOTE: there is also a method called readline() which returns just one line from a file.
Repeatedly runnning readline() method will return subsequent lines from the file.

strip()
It strips leading/trailing characters from a string
syntax:
string.strip(characters)
NOTE: If characters are not provided, default is spaces
eg: txt = ",,,,,rrttgg.....banana....rrr"
       x = txt.strip(",.grt")

print(x) will give banana


writelines() method writes items of a list to a file, while write() only handles a single line
syntax: <filename>.writelines(namelist)
