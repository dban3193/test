Datatypes in Python

To get  a character in string using index location

print("Delilah"[5])
will print "a"


1>Integer

print("123" + "234") -> 123234

print(123 + 234)-> 357

In python, large numbers are denoted as below

normal way : 12,35,256 (12lac35thou2hun5fifty6)
python way: 12_35_256 ~ 1235256

2>Float
decimal numbers
a=float(123) a is now a float called 123

print(123+ float("100.2"))
converst string 100.2 to float, adds it to 123 and prints final output

3>Boolean
True or False as values(Capital first letter)

type() tells us the type of variable(integer/string/boolean etc)

num_char=len(input("what is name"))
ultimately num_char gets an integer value

 str(num_char)=new_num_char
num_char integer value is now converted to string

print("your name has " + new_num_char + "characters")
for above line to work, new_num_char had to be a string so that concatenation works. Hence str function was used.

print("there are " + str(36) + "Shaoilin Temples")
there are 36 shaoilin temples







Mathematical operators
+ - integer+float=float
-
*
/ - even if division is performed on integers, output will always be float. infact print(4/2) inspite of a clean division provides output as 2.0
To make sure division of integers give an integer use //
print(4//2)-> 2
print(4/2)->2.0

exponential stuff = 4 **3 = 64 (4 to the pwer 3)

follows PEMDAS rule for priority(BODMAS as child)
P=parenthesis
E=exponential
M=multiplication
D=division
A=addition
S=subtraction


Rounding numbers

round() function is used

print(round(8/3)) => 3
print(round(8/3,2)) => 2.67 (2 here means 2 decimal places round needed)


score=score+1  OR score += 1


F-strings

You dont have to use str(),int(),float() for any conversions further
instead use a generalised fstring, and add your variable(whatever type) inside curly braces
python decodes everything for you as string

eg: 
my weight is 50=a
my height is 2.2=b
my name is Debyani=c

add an f to the beginning of your sentence

print ( f"my name is {c}, i am {b) meters tall and my weight is {a} kg")
this will take care of all type casting required
