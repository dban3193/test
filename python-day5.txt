For loops,Range and Code Blocks

For can stream through a list, one by one.
for a in list:
 print(a)


sum(list) function is used to iterate through a list and add its components
another variation would be sum(list,start)
whatever value is start will be added to list sum at the end.

max(list) function will give me the highest value in this list
similarly min(list) is for lowest value

range() is another function that could be used
for number in range(1,11)
considers 1 to 10(exclusive of 11)

shuffle() function in random module helps you randomly shuffle contents of a list.
random.shuffle(list)

join() helps you club elements together without a for loop
eg: to print abcde, you will need to iterate through a-e using for loop and then keep adding them to a defined string variable

but if you use join() as below:
str=""
str1="".join(<listname>)
print(str)->abcde
