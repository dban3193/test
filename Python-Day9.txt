Dictionaries and Nesting

Dictionaries let you group together and tag related pieces together
they occur in a key value pair format.
{ key1:value1,key2:value2....}

good practice:

variable= {
    key1:value1,
     key2:value2
      }

1>to retrieve a key:value

variable[key]> outputs the value

2>to add a key:value pair to dictionary

variable[key]=value

****same command as above to be used if editing value of a predefined key

3>to initialise a dictionary

dic_name = {} unlike for list it is []

4>to wipe out contents of a dictionary

same as above, dic_name = {}

5> for key in dictionary_name
#to print key names
           print(key)
# to print values only
           print(dictionary_name[key])


Nested dictionary
having lists/dictionaries inside a dictionary




eg:
travel_log = {
  "France": {"cities":["paris","lille","dijon"],"total_visits":12},
   "Germany":["Berlin","Hamburg","Stuttgart"]
}
Note we can have lists in dictionaries, dictionaries inside dictionary and dictionaries inside list

To add a dictionary to a list,created a function
def fun(pass the variables)
  define a dictionary
  dictionary_name[key]=variable
  and finally,
  list.append(dictionary)
