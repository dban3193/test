Python-day 1

print("") -> treats content like a text inside quotes
print(""+"")-> concatenates stuff
print(""'+'"")-> treats entirety as a text including the +

python cares about indentation, so always start your line without any gap

print("A"\n"B")-> pints A and B in successive lines


input("")->asks the question to user based on text inside quotes and waits for a input
once provided that entire function is converted to plain output

eg: print("Hello "+input('What is your name')+ "!")
this first takes input function, asks what is your name, on getting A as input finally prints Hello A!

len() ->prints the length of the string passed to it.
eg: ask for name and print it's char size

print(len(input("what is your name ")))
this asks what is your name, input comes as Rose,len function converts len(Rose) to 4 and finally print function prints 4.

above could be simplified as:
name=input("what is your name ")
length=len(name)
print(length)
