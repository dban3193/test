Day-7

We will be building hangman project using for and while loops,if/else,lists,strings,range and modules

basically there is a word whose letters need to be indentified. For every incorrect guess, hangman picture will get a body part added. You need to make sure that you identify the word before hangman picture completes.

New things that helped.
word.index(pass_letter)=gives index position for pass_letter in word

IN 
while "_" in list:
	do stuff

it will keep checking until "_" is part of list.Once it is replaced at all positions by other elements, the while loop quits

NOTE: IN works similar way in for as well as if/else loops

for an eexceptional situation where you lose before "_" gets addressed in the word, the above while loop is incorrect as a result of which you cant get out of loop to new game
in such cases, we defined a variable called game_end=false at the start
while game_end is False:
	do stuff

when lives become 0, negate the game_end value
as a reult you will come out of the while loop that was created
